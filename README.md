<h1 align="center">ETIP - Îµxodus Tracker Investigation Platform</h1>

**ETIP** is meant to ease investigations on tracker detection. For the moment, it offers few features:

* Track all modifications on trackers
* Detect rules collisions for both network and code signature

The official instance of ETIP is available [here](https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/).
